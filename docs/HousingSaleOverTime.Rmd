This Rmarkdown file will make a graph of the MaxTemp data. The code below is 
tabbed so that it properly knits to the webpage. Make sure you remove the eval=FALSE!!

```{r}
  library(Housing)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(dplyr)
  
ggplot(HousingMarket, aes(y = Median.Sale.Price, x = Month.of.Period.End, color = Region, group = Region)) +
    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
    geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(
      title = "Days on Market Trends for January of Each Year",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Median Sale Price",
      color = "Region"
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 


```
  
We see that the amount of days a house stays on the market have a trend of decreasing for every region for the past few years.
